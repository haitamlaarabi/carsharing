# Generic Carsharing Simulation Framework
## An agent based framework developped using @MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation)

A generic software framework for car sharing modelling in order to:

- Separate the mobility simulation of the car sharing system from its operational model.
- Easily customize and extend the framework.

While the components of the operational model can be aggregated into the following features:

- Station: Conventional & free-floating stations with various power distribution models
- Vehicle: Conventional, electric, purpose-specific vehicle models
- Booking: Early booking and immediate booking
- Rental: Offers, Pricing schemes, monetary incentives (e.g., user-based relocation, free-floating trips, multiple offers)
- Membership: Subscription & User-choice models
- Trips: Direct, Multiple Stops
- Relocation: User-based and operator based relocation policies
