# Generic Carsharing Simulator
## An agent based transportation simulation framework based on @MATSim

A generic software framework for carsharing modelling in order to:
- Separate the carsharing mobility simulation from the corresponding operational model.
- Be customizable and extendable.

The components of the operational model can be aggregated into the following features:
- Station: Conventional & free-floating stations with various power distribution models
- Vehicle: Conventional, electric, purpose-specific vehicle models
- Booking: Early booking and immediate booking
- Rental: Offers, Pricing schemes, monetary incentives (e.g., user-based relocation, free-floating trips, multiple offers)
- Membership: Subscription & User-choice models
- Trips: Direct, Multiple Stops
- Relocation: User-based and operator based relocation policies
